Hello!
This is the only place on the internet where you can find RISHAAN'S SKINPACK.
This is a project made by Rishaan Dayal.
It can only be used in Minecraft Education Edition for now, but if it gains steam, I might release it on Java and later, Bedrock.
Our goal is to provide high-quality Minecraft Skins for free, and to add more than Minecraft Education's built-in skins.
I hope you guys like it!
